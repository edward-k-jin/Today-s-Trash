            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Last updated: January 28, 2026</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Today's Trash. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to
                privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you
                have in relation to it.</p>

            <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
            <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not verify your identity or collect personal information such as
                your name, email address, or phone number. The notes you write are stored locally on your device using
                LocalStorage and are designed to be deleted automatically at midnight.</p>
            <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect non-personal information about how you interact with our
                website to improve our service. This includes device type, browser type, and pages visited.</p>

            <h2>3. Cookies and Third-Party Advertising</h2>
            <p>We use third-party advertising companies (Google AdSense) to serve ads when you visit our website. These
                companies may use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website or other websites.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on
                    their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.</li>
                <li>Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a
                        href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Analytics</h2>
            <p>We use Google Analytics to analyze traffic and usage patterns. Google Analytics collects information
                anonymously. It reports website trends without identifying individual visitors.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>Your "trash" notes are stored only on your local browser and are programmed to be deleted from
                LocalStorage when the date changes. We do not transmit this content to any external server.</p>

            <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
